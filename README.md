### How to generate an accurate Contributors list
To get commit authors from the repo:
```
git shortlog -sne
```
Then convert names/usernames to GitHub profile links in this format:
- Name — https://github.com/<github-username>

If you have contributors' emails but no GitHub usernames, you can ask them to provide their GitHub profile or search by email on GitHub.

  - Next.js — https://github.com/vercel/next.js
  - Tailwind CSS — https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss
